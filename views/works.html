        Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1976 when he formed a contract with MITS
        (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) to develop a basic
        operating system for their new microcomputers. In the early days, Bill
        Gates would review every line of code. He was also involved in several
        aspects of Microsoftâ€™s business such as packing and sending off orders.
